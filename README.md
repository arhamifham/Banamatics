  ## Running the code

  Copy the files in `backend` folder into a folder called `banamatix_backend` in your localhost. Change the path within the files if the local host is not xampp or the port number is not '8001'.

  The database named `b_user` should contain a table named `user_details` with 7 columns as `id (primary), username, password, email, coins, themes, themes_s`.

  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
